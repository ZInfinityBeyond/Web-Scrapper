# Yahoo Finance Web-Scrapper


## Synopsis
My First Python Project

Coded a Web Scrapper using Selenium that goes to Yahoo Finance and extracts stock info

## Installation 
 Run in Command line
 1. __pip install selenium__ or __conda install selenium__ if your using Anaconda.
 2. Get the latest webdriver for your operation system. I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc&ab_channel=TechWithTim "TechWithTim Selenium Setup") for setting up and I think I'll be helpful to you.

# Final Thoughts
For the code I'll put comments on what you should replace if you want to run this yourself there is also an image below of what the final project will look like but other than that I hope you enjoyed.
